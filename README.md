# Matterport SDK Next.js Starter

This is an attempt to create a Next.js starter that shows how to integrate both the [Matterport WebComponent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@matterport/webcomponent) and [@matterport/sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@matterport/sdk).

The WebComponent is loaded dynamically as our NPM Package is not compatible with server side rendering.

Upon installing, the latest version of our matterport-assets will automatically run - this is helpful for use within code sandbox environments.

Try it on Stackblitz.com: [https://stackblitz.com/edit/mpsdk-next-starter](https://stackblitz.com/edit/mpsdk-next-starter) -- you'll need to click 'Open in New Tab' on the preview to see the @matterport/sdk preview as StackBlitz.com has CORS restrictions that prevent the IFRAME from rendering.
